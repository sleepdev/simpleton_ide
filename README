Simpleton IDE is a development environment for people who lack the ability to remember thousands of secret key combos or where in 3 nested menus the simplest of functionality is hidden. 

Features
   Generic Text Editor with search and replace
   *Context Zoom

Context Zoom is a similar idea to code folding. The two are essentially the same, reverse what gets hidden.

Code Folding -> Selected Code appears/disappears, surrounding code remains
Context Zoom -> Hidden code appears, surrounding context disappears

The benefit and crux of context zoom being that you can only do one thing at a time; thus, it is an IDE for non-multitasking simpletons. Context is determined by indentation only, and thus is usable for editing most languages.
