Simpleton IDE is a development environment for people who lack the ability to remember thousands of secret key combos or where in 3 nested menus the simplest of functionality is hidden. 

Features
   Generic Text Editor with regex based search and replace
   *Context Zoom

Context Zoom is a similar idea to code folding. The two are essentially the same, reverse what gets hidden.

Code Folding -> Selected Code appears/disappears, surrounding code remains
Context Zoom -> Hidden code appears, surrounding context disappears

The benefit and crux of context zoom being that you can only do one thing at a time; thus, it is an IDE for non-multitasking simpletons. Context is determined by indentation only, and thus is usable for editing most languages.


Context can also be used to browse project folders. There is less distinction between in/out of a file. The whole development cycle then becomes like browsing a tree structured filesystem, with editing individual code blocks being the leaves.


Boxing of indented blocks can be turned off by adding it to the list of exceptions. Exceptions take into account the full context of this code block including the file path by using multiple consecutive lines.

Example exception file for blocking:
"""
^.*\.py$
^(if|while|for) .*$ 

^.*\.c$
^(if|while|for)( |\().*$
"""
